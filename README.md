# simple-css-slider

This is a demo of a simple navigation slider written in CSS3. It is lightweight, and ideally should work on most modern browsers(IE9+).

The code has 0 lines of JavaScript.

I have used the :target pseudo selector to trigger a css transition that changes the width of the element. The code is extremely simple and it creates a sliding effect, while avoiding the need for any JQuery/JavaScript.
